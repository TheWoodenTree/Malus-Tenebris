text = "The fractures in the ceiling of the lower prison finally gave way today. I am relieved that nobody was injured or killed, however this is most unusual. Compounded by the sudden appearance of the ailment which has recently begun to spread like a plague to even His most loyal servants, I am led to the conclusion that we are being punished by Him for some wrongdoing.

To my knowledge, we have changed little in the way of our practices in the last several years, even before the discovery of the ancient sewer beneath the prison.

Why He decides to punish us now is an enticing thought, though it is not my place to question His actions. I expel the thought so that it may fester and rot on this page rather than pollute my mind.
