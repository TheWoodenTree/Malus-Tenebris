I regret to inform you that conditions have been deteriorating since the recent rainfall. Diversion of the flood waters to the depths became critical. It being an ancient sewer system, however old, this made the most sense.

Unfortunately, I don't believe it has the capacity to hold this much water, as the water level has risen to about one and one-half feet. I worry that another harsh rain may render the depths impossible to navigate.

Many of my men have also become sick, however this is no illness I have ever seen. It is hard to describe with words; it is as I am watching the life drain from their eyes. Some of them can no longer form coherent sentences.

While my apothecary has been working to create a cure, the circumstances surrounding recent events have stirred fear and confusion among much of the Sect. I apologize that I can offer no explanation as to the source of these incidents as of yet.

In the interest of good faith, we have begun to expedite the Atonement rituals despite the current conditions. Perhaps He will reward us.

Gloria Mars Ultor"
