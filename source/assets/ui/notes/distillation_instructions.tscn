text = "Trial #13: First Successful Cure

Distill Ruboleum by pouring a substantial amount inside an opaque flask. Heat the flask with an open flame and wait for the substance to vaporize. When the vapor returns to a purified liquid form and drains into the cup, it should be potent enough to temporarily cure the effects of Vitriscet.

However fast acting the cure is, the amount of time it stays effective is rather insubstantial, only a few minutes. Regardless, this is a breakthrough.

It should be noted that the length that the cure remains effective increases with the number of doses taken, but only to an extent. Any doses taken after the third consecutive dose seem to be fruitless. As such, it is recommended that those experiencing symptoms take up to three doses at a time for maximum effectiveness.

Rather concerning, however, is whatever residue should be left inside the distilling flask after the process is finished is nonexistent, which did not happen in the trials with the clear flask."
