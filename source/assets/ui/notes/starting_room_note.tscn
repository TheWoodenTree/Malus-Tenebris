I didn't deserve this. I don't know why I've been imprisoned nor do I know who my captors are. Their strange garb entices my imagination, though some unpleasant thoughts about their true purpose have invaded my mind which leaves me more on edge than I already am.

Entry 2:

I've seen other prisoners being taken from their cells, though not toward the way we came in. Some return, some do not. I have yet to be taken, and I can't decide if I would rather leave this wretched cell and potentially face my demise or remain here and rot for God knows how long.

I have accepted that I will likely meet my end in this stone coffin.

Entry 3:

Though it's very dark, I've discovered a small passage just big enough for me to fit through behind the shelf in the corner of the room. I don't know what lies on the other side, but the curiosity is eating me alive.

Entry 4:

The hunger pains have subsided as I haven't seen anybody in what feels like days, and to my knowledge, I am the last prisoner still in this area. No guards have been through here in a long while.
