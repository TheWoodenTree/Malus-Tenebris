I should have known better than to speak out against the regent. It seems, however, that my suspicions were not unfounded. There's something more going on inside this prison than simple executions. 

The guards wear strange attire I've never seen before, and they refuse to acknowledge my attempts to communicate.

Entry 2:

As the days draw on, horrible thoughts invade my mind as to the true purpose of this prison, and I cannot bring myself to think what may have happened to my son when he was brought here those years ago. To think he was taken here to be used for some twisted purpose, all on the baseless accusation from an unscrupulous lord... it fills me with rage.

My son never murdered a man in cold blood. Until my dying breath, I will refuse that.

Entry 3:

I've seen other prisoners being taken from their cells, though not toward the way we came in. Some return, some do not. I have yet to be taken, and I can't decide if I would rather leave this wretched cell to find the truth and meet my demise or stay and rot, tormented by endless speculation about my son's last moments.

Though it's very dark, I've discovered a small passage just big enough for me to fit through behind the shelf in the corner of the room. I don't know what lies on the other side, but I cannot bear being left alone with my thoughts much longer.

Entry 4:

The hunger pains have subsided as I haven't seen anybody in what feels like days, and to my knowledge, I am the last prisoner still in this area. No guards have been through here in a long while.

Perhaps this is my opportunity.
