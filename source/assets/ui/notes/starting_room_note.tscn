I didn't deserve this. I am not responsible for the heinous crimes I've been accused of. Nothing regarding my situation has been explained to me.

I suppose I am to just believe that I am guilty, and that I will remain here until they find a use for me. My stomach churns at the thought.

Entry 2:

I've seen other prisoners being taken from their cells, though not toward the way we came in. Whatever's being done to them, some aren't returning.

I have a suspicion that the moment I was taken I was as good as dead. My children... I loathe the thought of them losing their father.

Entry 3:

I heard a couple guards speaking of something happening deeper in this prison. I only heard a few words, but they sounded concerned. Perhaps they will let me go. I doubt it.

Behind the shelf in the corner of the room lies a small passage - seemingly the only other way out of this room. If I plan to attempt an escape, this appears to be my only means, but I first need the courage to do so.

Entry 4:

I haven't seen anybody in what feels like days. As far as I can tell, there are no prisoners left in the cells around me. No guards have come through this area in a long while.

Perhaps this is my opportunity.
